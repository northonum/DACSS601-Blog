    "contents": "\r\nHW3 Overview\r\nThis is homework assignment #3 for Jason O’Connell. I have found some interesting data on profession tennis on github and I think I will use this for my final project. I will try to find something interesting to analyze. Current thoughts including looking at the number of matches per year necessary to achieve a ranking that supports sufficient prize winnings. There is a big problem in professional tennis that is hidden by the top professional making millions. Many, many, many players ranked under 100 in the world are required to make the sport what it is but these players barely survive. I would like to see the number of low ranking players cycling through the ATP to support the high ranking millions years.\r\nMaybe initial question for this homework can be relevance of height of match winner on different court surfaces. Theory: Height matters more on grass than hard than clay???\r\nInitialize Libraries\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the data\r\nFirst read ATP data file, here I am using only the results from 1980 from GITHUB source\r\n\r\n\r\nATP1980 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_1980.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding Plots\r\nLet’s start with a basic plot of the player heights by winners and losers.\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(ATP1980, aes(x=winner_ht, y=loser_ht)) + \r\n  geom_point() + \r\n  labs(title=\"Tennis matches winner vs. loser height\", x=\"Winner Height (cm)\", y=\"Loser Height (CM)\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell that was not very informative - since the frequency of the occurrences is somewhat obscured. Let’s try including some way to show the frequency of occurances using size of the dot.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ATP1980 %>%\r\n#           group_by(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n#           summarise(winner_ht,loser_ht, count = n())\r\n\r\nggplot( ATP1980 %>%\r\n          group_by(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n          summarise(winner_ht,loser_ht, count = n()), aes(x=winner_ht, y=loser_ht)) + \r\n  geom_point(aes(size=count)) +\r\n  labs(title=\"Tennis matches winner vs. loser height\", x=\"Winner Height (cm)\", y=\"Loser Height (cm)\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is nicer looking but still not very informative. I don’t see any pattern to indicate height advantage Let’s compute the height difference between the winner and the loser, the number of occurances and start including the court surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ATP1980 %>%\r\n#   drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n#   group_by(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n#   summarise(winner_ht,loser_ht, count = n())\r\n\r\nggplot( ATP1980 %>%\r\n          drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n          mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n          group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n          summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()), aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) + \r\n  geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n  labs(title=\"Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# ATP1980 %>%\r\n#   drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n#   group_by(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n#   summarise(winner_ht,loser_ht, count = n())\r\n\r\nggplot( ATP1980 %>%\r\n          drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n          mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n          group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n          summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()), aes(x=surface, y=ht_diff, fill=surface)) + \r\n  geom_violin() +\r\n  labs(title=\"Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Surface\", y=\"Height Differance\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nWell I think I used a number of new functions and saw some interesting data. I don’t think height has as significant a role in the winner and losers on the ATP tour in 1980. I wonder if this is still the case in the 2010s/20s now that racket technology, fitness, and several other factors have changed the game so much. More to come…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nLatest Overview\r\nLatest iteration (v5) of ATP Tennis Statistics Analysis.\r\nSo far exploration has been in the area of relevance of player height on match outcomes on different surfaces and by decades.\r\nFor this iteration: I will explore more fully the data available in each data set and see what other topics are interesting.\r\nInitialize Libraries\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the data\r\nFirst read ATP data files, here I am using only the results from 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 from GITHUB source\r\nThe data includes detailed information about each match played on the ATP tour in a given year. Tournament Data: tourney-id (YYYY-###), tourney_name, surface, draw_size, tourney_level, tourney_date Match Data: match_num, score, best_of, minutes, round Player Data (for each winner & loser): _id, _seed, _entry (WC, Q), _name, _hand, _height, _ioc, _age, _rank, _points Match Statistics (for each w & l): _ace, _df, _svpt, _1stIn, _1stWon, _2ndWon, _svGms, _bpSaved, _bpFaced\r\n\r\n\r\nATP1980 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_1980.csv\")\r\nATP1990 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_1990.csv\")\r\nATP2000 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_2000.csv\")\r\nATP2010 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/master/atp_matches_2010.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding Improved HW4 Plot\r\nFirst I will improve on my visuals from last HW and look at them with the new data from this homework.\r\nInsights\r\nThis graphs is a huge improvement over what I was doing in the last HW. Learning geom_smooth() in tutorial 6 really helps. I can quickly see the blank surface data is sort of noise that I should eliminate. Also can see pretty easily the the data is skewed toward the taller player winning but also the more matches are played on clay then hard, then carpet?, and finally grass. I am not sure they even play on carpet anymore - we will check in the 2010 file.\r\nIn the other files missing court surface isn’t an issue. Let’e redo 1980 eliminating the missing surface rows and inlcude the other years with the same plot:\r\n1980\r\nThere is some erroneous data where the court surface isn’t included so the filter is set to only include the 4 court surface types.\r\n\r\n\r\nATP1980 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  filter(str_detect('Clay|Hard|Carpet|Grass', surface)) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) + \r\n    geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    geom_smooth(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    labs(title=\"1980 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATP1980 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  filter(str_detect('Clay|Hard|Carpet|Grass', surface)) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n#  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n#  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(ht_diff, fill = surface)) + \r\n    geom_histogram() +\r\n    labs(title=\"1980 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1990\r\n\r\n\r\nATP1990 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) + \r\n    geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    geom_smooth(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    labs(title=\"1990 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat one looks pretty good.\r\n2000\r\n\r\n\r\nATP2000 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) + \r\n    geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    geom_smooth(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    labs(title=\"2000 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame for this one.\r\n2010\r\n\r\n\r\nATP2010 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  filter(str_detect('Clay|Hard|Grass', surface)) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) +\r\n    geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    geom_smooth(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    labs(title=\"2010 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmmm I’ve got a weird outlier - let’s get rid of that.\r\n2010v2\r\n\r\n\r\nATP2010 %>%\r\n  drop_na(winner_ht, loser_ht) %>%\r\n  filter(str_detect('Clay|Hard|Grass', surface)) %>%\r\n  mutate(ht_diff=winner_ht-loser_ht) %>%\r\n  filter(ht_diff < 100) %>%\r\n  group_by(surface, ht_diff) %>%\r\n  summarise(surface, ht_diff, count = n()) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=ht_diff, y=count)) +\r\n    geom_point(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    geom_smooth(aes(color=surface)) +\r\n    labs(title=\"2010 Match Winner vs. Loser Height Differance by Surface\", x=\"Height Difference\", y=\"Number of Matches\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCombine the data and compare years\r\nNow I will combine the data sets and see what it looks like over the decades.
